# deBruijn

This is my first program in Haskell, and the first time I'm doing functional programming. The --check and the --unique parameters work, but I didn't code the --clean parameter yet. Also it cannot generate sequences. However if you wanna check whether a sequence is a deBruijn sequence or not, it will work fine. Don't mind the conditional nesting :D. The code is open, feel free to use it.
